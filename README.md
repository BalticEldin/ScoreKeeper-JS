#ScoreKeeper-JS

ScoreKeeper is an interactive web application built using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap for responsive design and custom styles), and JavaScript. The app allows users to track scores for a two-player game, with the flexibility to set a custom winning score ranging from 3 to 10. As players click the respective buttons to increment their scores, the app dynamically updates the displayed values in real-time. When a player reaches the winning score, the game ends, and the winning player is highlighted, while the losing player is marked accordingly. The score buttons are disabled to prevent further scoring. The app also includes a reset feature, which clears the scores, re-enables the buttons, and restores the initial game state with a default message. Bootstrap is used to ensure a responsive layout, ensuring the app functions smoothly on different screen sizes, while custom CSS enhances the visual experience by adding personalized styles for the winner and loser, as well as formatting the page. Overall, ScoreKeeper provides a simple yet engaging way to track and manage scores for two-player games.
